/**
 * COGNITIVE DEBUGGER - ADVANCED AI-POWERED DEBUGGING SYSTEM
 *
 * This is NOT reactive debugging. This is PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE.
 *
 * The Cognitive Debugger thinks like a senior software engineer:
 * - It sees problems BEFORE they happen
 * - It understands user INTENT and maps it to potential failures
 * - It traces code flow across the ENTIRE codebase
 * - It learns from PATTERNS to predict future bugs
 * - It analyzes code from MULTIPLE dimensions simultaneously
 *
 * "The best bug fix is the one you never have to make."
